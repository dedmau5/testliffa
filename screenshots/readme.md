# Info
This folder contains screenshots. Surprise!!

We dont want the screenshots in git so we ignore them via .gitignore file. Though we want the folder "screenshot" in git. This since Jenkins have problems creating this folder and generate faild builds because of that.

So why all this bullsh*t talk in this file. Well, git doesn't like to include empty folders (they track files don't folders), so I need a dummy file in it.
